# dockerized-keystone
Keystone Docker instance for Hummingbird/Swift SAIO

This helps to run [Keystone](https://github.com/openstack/keystone) in a container which you can spin up & down for Hummingbird/Swift SAIO.

You can run Keystone with http(default) or https( -e HTTPS_ENABLED=true)

For HTTP:
Just use `make bootstrap` to build & run keystone container in http mode.

For HTTPS:
Use `make bootstrap-ssl` to build & run keystone container in https mode.
`make bootstrap-ssl` also generate ssl cert & key in `$pwd/ssl` directory.
You can pass this keystone ssl cert(`$pwd/ssl/keystone.crt`) to make https requests to Keystone.

You can provide hostname with `-h {hostname}` with docker run.

You can use `docker logs -f keystone` to check on bootstrap progress


In order to run swift functional tests with this keystone, you will need to make following changes:
